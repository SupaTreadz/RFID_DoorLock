# RFID_DoorLock
Code for my Arduino RFID Door Lock

Yes, my coding practices are atrocious, I know :P

Feel free to suggest improvements, it works as is though so I don't see much need to change it once I finally get it working haha.

Most of the RFID code came from this tutorial (really good one): http://bildr.org/2011/02/rfid-arduino/
And most of the Neopixel ring stuff came from the Adafruit Neopixel library which I love
