# RFID_DoorLock
Code for my Arduino RFID Door Lock

Only difference between v4 and v5 is code for the magnetic door sensor and associated interrupt. Prevents the door from locking when it is open. 

Feel free to suggest improvements, it works as is though so I don't see much need to change it once I finally get it working haha.

Most of the RFID code came from this tutorial (really good one): http://bildr.org/2011/02/rfid-arduino/
And most of the Neopixel ring stuff came from the Adafruit Neopixel library which I love
